Bio:
Cameron grew up without the internet or television. His first exposure to anything CS was the Mac Classic he inherited from his parents. When the internet was created it was not available, so Cameron created static html pages for his own internet-like experience. After a productive time with the Marine Corps, Cameron pursued a CS degree at UT Austin, and has been coding his way to a new career ever since.

Responsibilities:
Cameron took on creating and implementing the APIs, creating and managing the webserver, documenting the APIs via apiary, maintaining the unit tests, and managing collaberation.
